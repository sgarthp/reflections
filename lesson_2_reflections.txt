What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


    The git meta data is created to identify the directory as a git
    repository.  Before you can start tracking changes to the files in
    you repository you need to identify it as a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area identifies files that are being worked on that
    are i nthe working directory.  Later, when you wish to commit your
    work to the repository it will be these files only that are
    committed.

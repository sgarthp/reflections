What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


    The git meta data is created to identify the directory as a git
    repository.  Before you can start tracking changes to the files in
    you repository you need to identify it as a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area identifies files that are being worked on that
    are in the working directory.  Later, when you wish to commit your
    work to the repository it will be these files only that are
    committed.
    
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

    You can make as many changes to the working directory as you'd
    like, but then by staging the files that make up a logical change
    only, you can commit each logical change from the staged changes.

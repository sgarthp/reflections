When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    A remote repository would let me collaborate with others on
    projects, and also allow me to work on a project from multiple
    local locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Changes can happen to the remote that are outside of your control,
    performed by other team members, so it is preferrable to
    scrutinize the synchronization.

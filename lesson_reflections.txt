BRANCHES

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?

     Branches would be handy for introducing a similar function but
     with an experimental feature.  It would let you keep that
     proposed change or feature isolated from the rest of the code, so
     that changes could continue with the main program.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    They kind of help with the understanding of the parents of each
    node and how that connects to the branch labels.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

    A merge takes two divergent code branches with different changes
    and brings them together to a single branch, to merge the
    functionlily and capabilities so work can continue on with the
    combined product.  The diagram helps display understanding of
    where the parts of the resulting branch came from.

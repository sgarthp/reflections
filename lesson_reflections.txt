BRANCHES

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?

     Branches would be handy for introducing a similar function but
     with an experimental feature.  It would let you keep that
     proposed change or feature isolated from the rest of the code, so
     that changes could continue with the main program.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    They kind of help with the understanding of the parents of each
    node and how that connects to the branch labels.
